## CodePush

In order to use code push you must be logged into the correct Microsoft App Center account.

### Prerequisites
```
npm install -g code-push
code-push login
```

At this point you will be required to log into the account tied to the code push public keys in Info.plist

### Deployment
```
code-push release-react BalanceWallet-iOS ios -d <DEPLOYMENT>
```

The deployment can either be `Staging` or `Production` depending on the mode of the application you wish to update was built in through XCode.

### Local Builds

In order to build the application in "release" mode but not use the code push distribution you must build the application using the scheme `LocalRelease`.

Building the application with the `Staging` scheme or `Release` scheme will result in your bundle being replaced by the live code push deployment on resume of the application.
